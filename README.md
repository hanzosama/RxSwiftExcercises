# RxSwiftExcercises

This repository contains some excercises related to the usage of RXSwift (RxCococa and so on) framework in iOS applications. This excercises are based on some online courses, one of them (that inspired me particulary) is  [Mastering rxswift in ios]( https://www.udemy.com/course/mastering-rxswift-in-ios/). 

## Excercises

Here you'll find the list of the excercises and a vrief description about each of them:

* [Camera Filter](https://github.com/hanzosama/RxSwiftExcercises/tree/master/CameraFilter): The target of this app is to apply image filters on images selected form the photos stored in the device gallery.

* [Todo List](https://github.com/hanzosama/RxSwiftExcercises/tree/master/TodoList): This is a very basic todo list app. The purpose is to use the some transform & filter operators of RxSwift to list task based in those filters.
* [Todo List](https://github.com/hanzosama/RxSwiftExcercises/tree/master/News%20App): This is a basic app to show news, using the free [News API](https://newsapi.org/) platform. The target is to see how to implement RxSwift/RxCococa to perform URLRequest in a different way.
